      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/bio.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>Based in the twin cities area Minnesota, I enjoy the four season weather of our lovely state known as the state of ten thousand lakes.</p>
      <p>Technology excites me, I like reading about collection, storage,manipulation and distribution of data.</p>
      <p>I'm currently working on web development to prepare for a career in data analytics and visualization</p>
      <p>After a busy day, I like to play soft music on a piano, there is a possibility I could record one or two compositions</p>
      <p>I enjoy travelling and collecting history, recently visited the computer history museum in Silicon Valley, it is amazing how much computing has changed within the last 15 years.</p>
